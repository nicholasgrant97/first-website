This project will explore NFL data to identify the type of injuries with the most lost time (games) per position. Injuries that occur during special teams play will be designated ST as the position except the kicker and punter positions.\n\nGoals\n\nIdentify the types of injuries that result in the most lost time (games). +access to data\nIdentify the positions that are most likely to suffer the most lost time (games). +access to data\nIdentify the injuries with the most lost time (games) per position. +access to data\n\n“This is data science”\n~Preceptor\nKane’s Free Data Science Bootcamp"
